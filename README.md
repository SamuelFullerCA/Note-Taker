## Description

Ever lose track of your thoughts? The Note Taker Application is the perfect solution! This application allows the user to write notes and post them to their board to review at anytime. This application uses a server so the notes persist regardless of when or how the user opens the application.

The user is then brought to the main note taker page. Once the user begins to write in the note title and note text, two buttons appear in the top right to either clear the note they are filling out, or to save the note. Once the note is saved it appears in the left side panel, where the user can review it at any time by clicking on it.

 Aditionally users can access the .json database of all saved notes by going to '/api/notes' in the searchbar.
